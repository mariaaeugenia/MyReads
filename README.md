# MyReads Project

First project for Nanodegree React. The challange was to create a page that would separate the books in three shelves: 
Currently reading, Read and Want to read. The user could also search other books by title or author and send them to the selves
they chosen.

All the layout and API files were developed by Udacity while the React part was done by me.

The project development can be found at **develop** branch.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`
